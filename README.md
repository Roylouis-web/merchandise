  ### Why certain languages were used ? 
  The list of languages used are:
  - ES6: ES6 had to be utilised in this project because of its modern and clean syntax, thereby ensuring clean code in the codebase

  - CSS3: Some CSS frameworks may slow down the app while the browser is trying to load them, so CSS3 was used instead in other to enable to app to load styles very quickly, thereby improving user experience.

  - Miragejs: Miragejs is an in memory mock api that is being temporarily used and it has proved to be very useful and it will continue to be utilised until the backend of the application is completed.

  - Reactjs: Being one of the modern and the most used Frontend framework, React was used in this project and has really being a great help. It provides the concept of components which could used to divide a huge codebase into smaller chunks thereby leading to clean code, it provides react-router-dom which brings about client side routing which helped a lot since our backend is not yet available in production.

  - Jest: Jest is a React testing framework and really does a great job when it comes to testing all components and functions in the codebase therefore minimizing the risks of bugs which could be very bad for the user experience.
