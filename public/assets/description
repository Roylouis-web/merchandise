   PRICE: 1,150,000
   ASIDE:
      Apple IPhone 14 Pro Max 6.7" 256GB - Dual Nano Sim - Deep Purple
    DESCRIPTION:
       The best iPhone ever, version 2022, size XL - we have the iPhone 14 Pro. The list of novelties this year includes the notch morphing into a pill, the introduction of an Always-On display, and an all-new primary camera - and while you can get all of that on the 14 Pro, the extra screen estate and longevity coupled with the Max's 'ultimate' status mean it has a market niche of its own.

        The Face ID notch that's been with us since the iPhone X was nobody's favorite, and perhaps its reincarnation as a pill is a step towards its eventual removal. But not before turning the eyesore into a feature - the pill is a Dynamic Island of notifications, blurring the line between hardware and software.

        In a similar vein is the Always-On display - a software feature only made possible now in Apple's world thanks to LTPO displays being able to ramp down to 1Hz refresh rate.

        A massive increase in brightness is also among the key developments this year, this one solely in the hardware department.

        Late to yet another party, Apple finally joins virtually every other manufacturer and introduces a camera with a Quad Bayer type sensor - the specs on the 48MP main unit don't read like any other, so apparently, it's an exclusive design. The telephoto remains unchanged, but the ultra-wide has gotten a sensor size upgrade, while the front-facing one now features autofocus (and even OIS).

        On the hardware front, there's the mandatory chipset update, of course, and little else worth mentioning. Well, there's the blanked-out SIM card slot. Crash detection and emergency sort-of satellite connectivity are also on the list of new features combining software and hardware.

        iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro do not include a power adapter or Ear Pods. Included in the box is a USB‑C to Lightning Cable that supports fast charging and is compatible with USB‑C power adapters and computer ports.

        We encourage you to re‑use your current USB‑A to lightning cables, power adapters and headphones that are compatible with these iPhone models. But if you need any new Apple power adapters or headphones, they are available for purchase.

      Infinix Note 11 Pro - 6.95" FHD+ (8GB RAM, 128GB ROM) Android 11 (64/13/2)MP + 16MP Selfie - 4G LTE - 5000mAh - Haze Green

        Infinix unveiled the new generation of its jumbo-sized Note series. Like its predecessor, the Infinix Note 10 Pro packs a 6.95” display – this is more of a small tablet than a large phone. For this generation, however, the refresh rate has been cranked up from 90 Hz to 120 Hz. The touch sampling rate remains at 180 Hz.

        Infinix Note 11 series unveiled: the Pro model has a 6.95'' 120Hz screen, 13MP tele camera
        It is an IPS LCD panel with 1,080 x 2,460 px resolution, same as before. But this year it has a new chipset driving it – the Helio G96 by MediaTek. This chip has a pair of Cortex-A76 CPU cores like its predecessor (the G95) and our testing shows that it has an edge in performance.

        Infinix Note 11 series unveiled: the Pro model has a 6.95'' 120Hz screen, 13MP tele camera
        The GPU was downgraded, however, from a Mali-G76 MC4 to a G57 MC2 and that shows in testing. Then again, the Helio G95 would have been a back pick for this phone since it can’t drive 1080p displays at 120 Hz (and the G96 clearly can). There is some hope that the Note 11 series will perform better than other G96-powered phones thanks to the 9 layers of graphene film that help keep the chipset cool.

        Infinix Note 11 series unveiled: the Pro model has a 6.95'' 120Hz screen, 13MP tele camera
        The Note 11 Pro comes with a higher base memory capacity – 8 GB of RAM and 128 GB storage, up from 6/64 GB. The microSD slot is still on board and even RAM can be extended as the new XOS 10 software (based on Android 11) can add 3 GB of virtual RAM. For the UFS 2.2 storage there is Infinix’s Write Booster that accelerates writing speed.

        The 64 MP rear camera is now joined by a 13 MP telephoto module. While it advertises 30x maximum zoom (digital, of course), the actual optical magnification is 2x. Also, the 8 MP ultra wide camera of the previous model has gone missing – there’s no ultra wide at all here, just a 2 MP depth sensor.

        Infinix Note 11 series unveiled: the Pro model has a 6.95'' 120Hz screen, 13MP tele camera
        This is one of the places where the vanilla Infinix Note 11 differs from the Pro. It has a 50 MP main camera and a “2 MP telephoto lens”, according to the press release, though that could be a typo for all we know. Anyway, both feature a 16 MP selfie camera on the front. The new chipset didn’t improve the video recording situation, by the way, the new models are still capped at 1080p 30 fps.

        Besides the camera, the Pro model also stands out with stereo speakers (top and bottom), which are part of what Infinix calls a Digital Theater System. But if you want a big screen, Infinix has prepared the phones to easily cast images and video (including screen mirroring) to TVs and laptops. If you want to keep it small instead, there is a 3.5 mm headphone jack (with an FM radio receiver).

        Mithril Grey, Haze Green and Mist BlueThe Infinix Note 11 Pro will be available in three colors: Mithril Grey, Haze Green and Mist Blue
        The 5,000 mAh battery on the Pro model supports 33W fast charging over USB-C, just like its predecessor. That battery should survive 800 charge cycles without a noticeable degradation in capacity, thanks to some TÜV Rheinland-approved charging tech. The power adapter is included in the retail box, plus a transparent silicone case and a glass screen protector.
